\section{Information}

Apo-Rodagon-D lenses are designed for the highest possible imaging quality for close-ups at just those scales around 1:1 where even the best enlarging lenses for larger scales begin to show their weak spots. Thus their typical applications are transparency duplication, the preparation of internegatives and – together with the Modular-Focus helical mount and the matching camera adapt-ers – macro photography. Furthermore, as well as for photog-raphy, they can also be used as high resolving optical systems for premium scanners
