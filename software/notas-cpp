enum = a way to give a name to a value;
	A way to create types.

enum Example {
	A, B, C
}

int main(){
	Example value = B
}
	
Pointers:

	A pointer is an integer that stores a memory address
	
	Memory is one big line (single street from start to end, with a row of houses that have addresses)
	
	Every house in this metaphor is one byte
	
	A pointer is an integer that holds an address: if it has a different data type it will be refering not to the pointer itself but to the expected data in the address.

	int main(){
		int vat = 8; 
		void* myPointer = &var;
}
